# Pool the DNA Methylation Data from Individual Cells to Create a Bulk-like Profile

## Description

As a bioinformatician, I would like to pool the individual DNA methylation calls from a set of cells, to create a bulk DNA methylation profile, in order to do DMR calling, and to determine methylation profiles for particular cell types.

## Notes

- Input: DNA methylation data for all cells (TSV-like format), a list of which cells to pool

- Output: DNA methylation data in TSV-like format, but pooled


- Some collaborators of mine have been calling this in-silico merging - Kieran

- I have some code I'm willing to share to do this, so it basically just needs to be wrapped in CWL. - Kieran
